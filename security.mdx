# Zero-knowledge proofs

ZeroSwaps uses zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) to prove transaction validity without revealing any details. This cryptographic primitive is the foundation of the entire privacy architecture.

The zero-knowledge proof system provides the following guarantees:

**Complete Transaction Privacy**: All transaction details including amounts, tokens, and participants remain hidden while still being verifiable by the network.

**Verifiable Correctness**: The network can verify that transactions are valid (sufficient balances, correct math, no double-spending) without seeing the actual values.

**No Trusted Setup Required**: ZeroSwaps uses modern zk-SNARK constructions that eliminate the need for trusted setup ceremonies, removing a potential security vulnerability.

**Efficient Proof Generation**: Proofs are generated quickly on the client side, ensuring fast transaction times without compromising privacy.

The cryptographic security of zk-SNARKs is based on well-established mathematical assumptions and has been extensively studied by the academic cryptography community.

## Smart contract security

All ZeroSwaps smart contracts have been designed with security as the primary consideration. The contracts undergo rigorous testing and auditing before deployment.

**Audited by Leading Security Firms**: Independent security audits by top blockchain security firms ensure that contracts are free from vulnerabilities.

**Tested Extensively on Testnets**: All contracts are deployed and tested on testnets for extended periods before mainnet deployment.

**Open Source and Verifiable**: All contract code is open source and verifiable on-chain, allowing anyone to audit the implementation.

**Regularly Updated with Security Patches**: The team monitors for new vulnerabilities and deploys security patches promptly when needed.

The non-custodial architecture means that even in the unlikely event of a contract vulnerability, user funds remain in their own wallets until the moment of swap execution.

## Best practices

To ensure maximum security when using ZeroSwaps, follow these recommended practices:

**Always Verify the Contract Address**: Before interacting with ZeroSwaps, verify that you are connecting to the official contract address published on the website.

**Use Hardware Wallets for Large Transactions**: For significant amounts, use a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor to add an additional layer of security.

**Keep Your Private Keys Secure**: Never share your private keys or seed phrases with anyone. ZeroSwaps will never ask for this information.

**Check Transaction Details Carefully**: Before confirming any transaction, carefully review all details including amounts, tokens, and gas fees.

**Stay Updated with Security Announcements**: Follow official ZeroSwaps channels for security announcements and updates.

By following these practices and leveraging the built-in security features, you can trade with confidence knowing your assets and privacy are protected.

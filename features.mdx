# Privacy Mode

Privacy Mode uses zero-knowledge proofs to hide your transaction details. This cryptographic technology allows the network to verify that your transaction is valid without revealing any information about the transaction itself.

When Privacy Mode is enabled, ZeroSwaps provides the following guarantees:

**Wallet Anonymity**: Your wallet address is not linked to the transaction, ensuring complete anonymity for both sender and receiver.

**Encrypted Amounts**: Transaction amounts are encrypted using zk-SNARKs, making it impossible for observers to determine how much you are swapping.

**No On-Chain History**: No transaction history is stored on-chain in a way that can be linked back to your wallet address.

**Complete Anonymity**: All parties involved in the transaction remain anonymous, with no possibility of linking transactions to specific users.

Privacy Mode is optional and can be toggled on or off for each transaction. When disabled, transactions behave like standard DEX swaps with full transparency.

## Token swapping

ZeroSwaps supports seamless token swapping with advanced features designed for both casual users and professional traders:

**Real-time Price Updates**: Live price feeds ensure you always get accurate market rates with minimal slippage.

**Automatic Slippage Protection**: Smart slippage detection prevents unfavorable trades by automatically adjusting tolerance based on market conditions.

**Gas Optimization**: Intelligent routing and batching minimize gas costs while maintaining fast execution times.

**Multi-token Support**: Swap between any supported ERC-20 tokens with a single transaction, no intermediate steps required.

The swap interface is designed for simplicity while providing advanced options for experienced traders who need precise control over their transactions.
